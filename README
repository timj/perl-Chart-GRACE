Chart::GRACE
-----------

This module provides a perl/PDL interface to the XMGR plotting package. 
Can be used to plot PDLs or Perl arrays.

A simple function interface is provided that is based on the
more complete object-oriented interface.


Requirements
------------

This module is written entirely in perl (no XS) but does require that
the PDL::Options module is installed. This is available as part of the
PDL distribution (http://pdl.perl.org) or separately in the PDL
directory on CPAN (e.g. in my author directory).

In addition to this module, the XMGRACE plotting tool is also required.
This can be downloaded from the GRACE web page. The GRACE home
page is at http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/ .

This module also requires a version of perl containing the IO::Pipe
and IO::File modules (tested with 5.00404). The named
pipe facility also requires that the POSIX::mkfifo command is supported
If POSIX::mkfifo is not available then the named pipe option will not
be available (and the npipe.t test will fail).


Building and installation
-------------------------

This package uses the standard CPAN installation system:
Unpack the distribution, change to the module directory and

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

The first command will fail if PDL::Options is not available.
The test script will launch XMGRACE and send some data to it. Each
test (one using simple pipes the other using named pipes) will launch
an XMGRACE process -- this process must be exited before the further
tests will start.

Full documentation can be found in the GRACE.pm file using POD.
